# Azomethane 

Very quick GSB/SE (actually from an SH trajectory, so shouldn't really generate
the GSB from this), with ZagHop, and the Orca driver on PBE0/TDDFT on
Azomethane (trans). 

See: https://github.com/Frost-group/ZagHop/tree/master/examples/LZ-orca

Random velocities. 

Convergence not checked. Amazed it works at all, really.
